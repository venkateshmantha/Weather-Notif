# Weather Notif

A short program in Python to receive weather updates on your phone using Twilio and WUnderground.

-For the program to work, you need to have an account with [Twilio. ](https://www.twilio.com/)
Alternately, if you plan on getting a trial account for development, you can read about it [here.](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136107-How-does-Twilio-s-Free-Trial-work-)

-You also need to have a subscription key from WUnderground for the weather data which can be obtained by signing up [here.](https://espanol.wunderground.com/weather/api)

-Once you have the credentials, integrating them into the program is a breeze as seen from their documentation below.

The program can be then deployed on to a server or run locally as a cron job to continue receiving alerts on your phone.
